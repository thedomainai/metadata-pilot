# Rule: os_meta/* are governed assets.

## Forbidden
- Do NOT modify vocab.yaml, entity_registry.yaml, policy_rules.yaml, schema.yaml
  unless the user explicitly requests a governed update.

## If you need a new value
- Do NOT add it ad-hoc.
- Mark the affected document meta as:
  - comp_conflicts includes "conflict:needs_vocab_update"
  - comp_safety_mode=locked_down
  - comp_label_quality=auto_low

  ## How to request a governed update
- Explicitly ask the user for a governed update.
- Clearly state:
  - which file needs a new value (vocab / registry / policy / schema)
  - the exact key or rule to be added or changed
  - the intended semantics and safety implications
- Until a governed update is approved:
  - Do NOT infer or simulate the new value.
  - Keep the document in locked_down mode.
